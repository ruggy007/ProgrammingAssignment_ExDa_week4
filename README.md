This R script retrieves and loads the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) data for Particulate Matter (PM2.5) from a specified URL. The script then reads two R Data Files (RDS): summarySCC_PM25.rds and Source_Classification_Code.rds. These files contain summarized emissions data and the source classification codes, respectively.

Output
The script loads the NEI data into the R environment, providing access to emissions data and source classification codes. Analysts and researchers can use this data for various analyses related to particulate matter emissions, sources, and classifications.

Data Files:
summarySCC_PM25.rds: Summarized emissions data for PM2.5.
Source_Classification_Code.rds: Source classification codes.

The scripts then generates plot 1 through 6
